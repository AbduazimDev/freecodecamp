## Project Description

This repository contains the projects that I completed to earn the Scientific Computing with Python certification from FreeCodeCamp. These projects showcase my ability to use Python to solve complex scientific computing problems, including numerical analysis, statistics, and data visualization.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured into five folders, each containing a project:

- [01. Arithmetic Formatter](./01-arithmetic-formatter)
- [02. Time Calculator](./02-time-calculator)
- [03. Budget App](./03-budget-app)
- [04. Polygon Area Calculator](./04-polygon-area-calculator)
- [05. Probability Calculator](./05-probability-calculator)

Each project folder contains a README.md file with a detailed explanation of the project and its requirements, a main.py file with the implementation, and a test_module.py file with unit tests for the implementation.

## Dependencies

The projects were developed using Python 3.8.3 and require the following third-party libraries:

- NumPy 1.18.5
- SciPy 1.5.0
- Matplotlib 3.2.2

These dependencies can be installed using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
